p(color:red;padding:1em;border:1px solid red;background:#fafafa;). We are currently revamping the Hominid gem for a version 2.0.0 release. The documentation is being updated, but the new gem is not quite available yet. Sorry if this causes problems.

h1. Hominid

Hominid is a Ruby gem that provides a wrapper for interacting with the Mailchimp email marketing service API ("version 1.2":http://www.mailchimp.com/api/1.2/)

h2. Installation

<pre><code>sudo gem install hominid</code></pre>

Hominid is hosted at "Gemcutter":http://gemcutter.org". Be sure that you have the Gemcutter gem installed if you are having trouble installing Hominid:

<pre><code>sudo gem install gemcutter
gem tumble</code></pre>

h2. Configuration

You will need to create a "Mailchimp":http://www.mailchimp.com account and get your API key (available at http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/) in order to get started.

If you are using Hominid inside a Rails application, you can create a config file at @/config/hominid.yml@ with your Mailchimp account information and basic configuration options. Simply run @rake hominid:config@ from within your rails application to generate a config file.

h2. Usage

To interact with the Mailchimp API, simply create a new Hominid object:

<pre><code>@hominid = Hominid.new</code></pre>

_or pass the configuration options directly_

<pre><code>@hominid = Hominid.new({:username => 'USERNAME', :password => 'PASSWORD', :api_key => 'API_KEY', :send_goodbye => false, :send_notify => false, :double_opt => false})</code></pre>

h3. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
# Fork the project.
# Make your feature addition or bug fix.
# Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
# Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
# Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
